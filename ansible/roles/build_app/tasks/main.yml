### build the Go application

# This builds without Make (no versioning info);
# binaries end up in <source_dir>/bin and are not copied.
#- name: Build app
#  command: go build -v {{ app.import_path }}/cmd/...
#  environment:
#    GOPATH: "{{ app.base }}/go"
#    GOBIN: "{{ app.base }}/bin"
#  become_user: "{{ app.user }}"
#  register: build_cmd

# This builds using the makefile (which adds versioning info);
# INSTALL env var tells where the binaries get copied to if the build was successful.
#
# WARNING: $PWD is not set correctly for the user; don't rely on it
#
# The build may use git commands that don't work properly in
# Centos7 default git 1.8.3.1, so use Git 2.9 instead.
